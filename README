OurAdventure
------------

OurAdventure is a text-based adventure program.


Installation Instructions
-------------------------

The OurAdventure build system is based on cmake and requires cmake 2.6 or 
higher.

The build system has only been tested on Linux.  Building on Mac OS X and
Windows is probably possible but may be difficult.

To build:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make

The executable will be in build/src/OurAdventure.  The default cave file is in
the tree at cave.dat.  You may install this into /usr/local with:
$ sudo make install

If you installed it, you may run the program with:
$ OurAdventure

Otherwise, you may run the program from the main OurAdventure directory with:
$ build/src/OurAdventure -c cave.dat
